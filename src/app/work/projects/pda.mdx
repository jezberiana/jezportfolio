## Overview

PDA Automata is a project that implements a Pushdown Automaton (PDA) to validate strings following the pattern `aⁿbⁿ` (where n ≥ 1). The application also provides an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) to interact with the PDA, making it a valuable tool for learning and visualizing automata theory.

## Key Features

- **String Validation**: Ensures that input strings adhere to the `aⁿbⁿ` pattern with equal numbers of 'a' and 'b' characters.
- **State Diagram Visualization**: Provides a graphical representation of the PDA's state transitions.
- **Interactive GUI**: Enables users to input strings and observe how the PDA processes them in real-time.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core language for implementing the PDA logic.
- **Tkinter**: Used to create the graphical user interface for enhanced interactivity.

## Challenges and Learnings

- **State Transition Logic**: Developing the PDA's logic to handle edge cases and ensure accurate string validation was a critical aspect of the project.
- **GUI Design**: Crafting a user-friendly interface required careful planning to make the tool accessible to students and educators alike.

## Outcome

The PDA Automata tool has proven effective for demonstrating the principles of pushdown automata in an educational setting. Its combination of theoretical rigor and visual interactivity has made it a valuable resource for understanding formal languages and automata theory.

## Usage

1. Launch the application using Python.
2. Input a string into the GUI to check its validity.
3. Observe the PDA's state transitions in real-time.
