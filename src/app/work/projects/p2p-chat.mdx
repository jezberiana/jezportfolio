## Overview

P2P Chat is a real-time communication platform designed to facilitate seamless interactions using WebSocket technology. Built with simplicity and scalability in mind, it enables multi-user environments while ensuring efficiency and responsiveness.

## Key Features

- **Real-Time Messaging**: Instant message delivery powered by WebSocket and Socket.IO.  
- **Multi-User Support**: Capable of handling multiple users in dynamic chatrooms.  
- **Static Front-End**: Lightweight, responsive UI implemented with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
- **Express.js Backend**: Serves static files and manages WebSocket connections effortlessly.  

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js & Express**: For server-side handling and routing.  
- **Socket.IO**: Enables real-time bi-directional communication.  
- **HTML, CSS, and JS**: Simplifies the client-side experience.  
- **Jest**: Ensures robust socket testing for error-free communication.  

## Challenges and Learnings

One of the primary challenges was optimizing WebSocket performance to handle multiple users concurrently without lag. Balancing reliability and minimal overhead required iterative testing and debugging.  

Another obstacle was creating a user-friendly interface that remains intuitive while maintaining essential features. Simplifying the UI without losing functionality underscored the importance of user-centered design principles.
