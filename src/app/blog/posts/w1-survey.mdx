For the first week of our research for **Project Buddle**, we focused on identifying the key academic challenges faced by students in the **College of Information Technology and Computing (CITC)**. To do this, we conducted a survey through a post on the **Student Council’s page**, gathering responses from 20 students.

## **Key Insights from the Interview**
Through our survey, three major struggles emerged among students:

### **1. Time Management**  
Many students find it difficult to balance their coursework with personal responsibilities and extracurricular activities. Deadlines, exams, and projects often pile up, making it a challenge to manage time effectively.

### **2. Understanding Course Material**  
Technical subjects require deeper comprehension, and many respondents mentioned struggling with grasping complex concepts. The lack of accessible explanations and structured learning resources adds to this difficulty.

### **3. Accessing Quality Tutoring**  
Several students highlighted the **lack of tutoring options** within CITC. While some rely on peer discussions or online resources, structured academic support is not always available when needed.

## **Challenges Experienced & How I Handled Them**
One of the main challenges I faced during this survey was **getting students to participate**. Some were hesitant due to time constraints, while others weren’t sure how their feedback would be used. To address this, I:  
- **Kept the survey concise and easy to answer.**  
- **Emphasized its impact** on improving academic support within CITC.  
- **Leveraged the Student Council's platform** to build credibility and reach more students.  

Filtering and analyzing responses also posed a challenge, but I tackled it by **categorizing answers into themes** and visualizing patterns for better insights.

## **Connecting These Findings to Project Buddle**
The survey confirmed the need for an accessible and structured **tutoring platform like Buddle**. By addressing the major student struggles—**time management, course comprehension, and tutoring accessibility**—we can design a solution that truly meets their academic needs.

Additionally, the **preferred tutoring methods** identified in the survey, such as **peer tutoring and online sessions**, will play a key role in shaping Buddle’s framework.

## **Looking Ahead**
This research has provided us with a **solid foundation** for defining our **problem statement**. Moving forward, we will refine our findings and start conceptualizing solutions based on the **real needs of students**.

This is just the beginning—excited to see where this journey takes us!
