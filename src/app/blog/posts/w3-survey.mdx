For **Week 3** of our **Project Buddle research**, I took on the responsibility of conducting **face-to-face interviews** with students. Unlike previous weeks, this approach allowed for **more natural discussions**, letting me observe their reactions and clarify responses in real-time.  

Due to privacy concerns, **only one student permitted a photo**, but we still gathered valuable insights from **nine respondents**. While we asked the same core questions as before, this weekâ€™s discussions revealed **new perspectives on learning support**.

## **Key Takeaways from This Week's Interviews**

### **1. Students Prefer Flexible, On-Demand Tutoring**  
Unlike the **structured schedules** proposed last week, many students in this round emphasized the need for **on-demand, flexible tutoring** instead. They feel that **fixed schedules might not fit their unpredictable workloads**, preferring a system where they can **request help when needed**.

### **2. Social Barriers Prevent Some Students from Seeking Help**  
Some respondents shared that they **hesitate to approach peers or tutors** due to:  
- Fear of **being judged for not understanding** certain topics.  
- Not knowing **who to ask** for help.  
- Feeling that **self-study should be enough**, even when struggling.  

This insight shows that Buddle must focus not just on accessibility but also on **building a welcoming and supportive learning culture**.

### **3. The Need for Subject-Specific Expertise**  
A concern raised by students was **the quality of tutoring assistance**. Some students have **tried asking for help** before but felt that their peers lacked the expertise to properly guide them. This suggests Buddle should:  
- **Verify and train tutors** before they assist students.  
- **Offer subject-specific tutor matching** instead of general help sessions.  

## **Challenges Faced During Face-to-Face Interviews**  
Since these were **in-person conversations**, I encountered a few hurdles:  
- **Some students were hesitant to be interviewed**, likely due to concerns over being recorded or judged.  
- **Limited photo permissions** meant we couldnâ€™t capture as many moments as previous weeks.  

To overcome this, I **kept the conversations casual and student-friendly**, ensuring they felt comfortable sharing their thoughts.

## **How This Impacts Buddleâ€™s Development**  
This weekâ€™s findings highlight a shift in student preferences and new areas of focus:  
- **Flexible, on-demand tutoring options** instead of rigid schedules.  
- **A welcoming, non-intimidating learning space** to encourage students to seek help.  
- **Qualified, subject-specific tutors** to ensure effective guidance.  

These insights will help refine Buddleâ€™s structure, balancing **accessibility, reliability, and student comfort**.

## **Next Steps**  
With three weeks of research complete, we now have diverse perspectives from **general students, academic leaders, and tutors**. Our next move is to **consolidate these findings** and have another interview.

Excited for whatâ€™s ahead! ðŸš€
