In **Week 5** of our research for **Project Buddle**, Ms. Renchille PateÃ±o led interviews with **eight students**, shifting the focus to **mental health challenges caused by academic pressure**. The findings highlight the **impact of workload stress, lack of instructor guidance, and the need for a balanced learning approach**.

## **Academic Pressure and Mental Well-being**  
Many students expressed that **academic expectations and deadlines** feel overwhelming. The pressure to **manage coursework, meet deadlines, and perform well** creates **high levels of stress**. Key concerns include:  
- **Insufficient Instructor Support** â€“ Many students feel that instructors are unavailable outside class hours, leaving them to navigate difficult topics alone.  
- **Workload Overload** â€“ A packed academic schedule often leads to burnout, making it harder to absorb lessons effectively.  
- **Fast-Paced Learning** â€“ Students struggle to fully grasp concepts before new topics are introduced.  

These challenges emphasize the **importance of balancing workload with student well-being**.

## **The Role of Instructors in Student Learning**  
A common concern was the **lack of accessible instructor support**. Students shared that:  
- **Instructors should be more available** â€“ Office hours or scheduled consultations can help address learning gaps.  
- **Practical Exercises Over Memorization** â€“ Applying real-world scenarios makes learning more engaging and effective.  
- **More Mentorship, Less Independent Struggle** â€“ While independent learning is encouraged, guidance should be readily available when needed.  

By improving instructor-student engagement, students can feel **more supported and confident in their learning journey**.

## **Proposed Solutions to Reduce Academic Stress**  
To create a more **student-friendly learning environment**, respondents suggested:  
- **Flexible Learning Pacing** â€“ Allowing students more time to master concepts before moving forward.  
- **Instructor-Led Study Sessions** â€“ Guided reviews to reinforce difficult topics.  
- **Balanced Workload Distribution** â€“ Avoiding excessive deadlines in a short timeframe.  
- **Mental Health Breaks** â€“ Incorporating wellness activities to help manage stress.  

These suggestions align with Buddleâ€™s goal of **fostering an academic environment that prioritizes both learning and well-being**.

## **Conclusion and Next Steps**  
The feedback from **Week 5** highlights the need for **stronger instructor involvement, improved pacing, and stress management strategies**. As Buddle continues to develop, these insights will guide our efforts to **build a more supportive and balanced academic experience for students at CITC**.  

By **bridging the gap between students and instructors**, we can create an educational system that **nurtures both academic success and mental well-being**. ðŸš€
