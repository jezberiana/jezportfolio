For **Week 8** of **Project Buddle**, **Japhet Japay** led **face-to-face interviews** with **eight students**. While the questions remained consistent with prior weeks, the responses revealed **heightened concerns around instructor feedback, peer dependency, and a lack of structured academic support**.

## **Academic Challenges Raised**
**Lack of Instructor Feedback** – Many students expressed concern over the absence of meaningful feedback on their outputs.  

> *"After we submit our outputs, we don’t really know if we did it right or what to improve. The grade is there, but the explanation isn’t."* — 3rd Year BSCS Student  

**Deadline Clustering and Fatigue** – Overlapping major requirements in multiple subjects are causing burnout.  

> *"We’re not tired of learning, we’re just tired of learning everything at once. It’s exhausting."* — 2nd Year BSIT Student  

**Inconsistent Teaching Practices** – Students feel that varying styles and resource-sharing habits among instructors make it difficult to create consistent learning routines.

**Peer Dependency** – Due to limited instructor access, students turn to classmates and group chats for help.

> *"Our barkada is our tutor now. If wala sila, wala na pud ko kasabot."* — 1st Year BSDS Student  

## **Tutoring Support Accessibility**
Most students rated tutoring support between **2 to 3 out of 5**, with common remarks including:  
- **Limited tutor availability**, especially for technical subjects  
- **Lack of awareness** about Buddle and how to access its services  
- **No formal scheduling system** for guaranteed one-on-one help  

## **Preferred Tutoring and Study Solutions**
Students suggested practical and scalable support systems:  
**Pre-recorded Walkthroughs** – "Useful for rewatching hard lessons at our own pace."  
**Group Study Sessions** – "Crash courses or review huddles would help before exams."  
**Subject-Specific Online Help Desks** – Discord or Facebook groups for direct Q&A  
**Chat-Based Tutoring Access** – Real-time or quick-reply system through Messenger or Canvas  

## **Proposed Improvements**
**Visibility Boost for Buddle** – Make the platform more prominent in Canvas, group chats, and classrooms  
**Streamlined Booking System** – A user-friendly portal to schedule tutoring sessions  
**Organized Shared Resources** – Central folders for notes, example outputs, and past quizzes  

## **Key Takeaways**
Week 8 underscored three critical insights:
1. **Students crave feedback** — not just grades, but guidance.
2. **Peer learning is valuable**, but shouldn’t be the only safety net.
3. **Tutoring access must improve**, especially in visibility, scheduling, and content delivery.

By responding to these needs, **Project Buddle** can close the academic support gap and reinforce its role as a **bridge between faculty, students, and learning success**.
