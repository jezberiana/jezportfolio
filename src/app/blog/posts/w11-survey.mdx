**Week 11** was all about iteration. Following last week’s feedback, our team implemented several **key improvements** to the Buddle MVP — most notably tutor profile previews, booking notifications, and session history logs. Assigned to gather this week’s insights was **Japhet Japay**, who conducted **face-to-face interviews with 20 new student testers**.

These students experienced the upgraded MVP firsthand, and their feedback helped validate whether the recent changes addressed the real concerns raised in Week 10.

## What’s New in the MVP
Before gathering responses, students were given a walkthrough of the new features:
- **Tutor Profile Previews** with short bios and subject expertise  
- **Notification Alerts** for confirmed bookings and tutor replies  
- A **Booking History Tab** showing past and upcoming sessions  
- A simplified **calendar view** for scheduling convenience  

> *“Mas klaro na karon. I can easily see kinsa ang tutor and kung unsay mga subjects iyang gi-handle.”* — 3rd Year BSCS Student  
> *“Nindot nga naay history og reminders. Di na ko maglibog kung na-book ba nako or wala pa.”* — 2nd Year BSIT Student  

## Positive Feedback from Respondents
Students appreciated how fast and clearly their suggestions were integrated:

**Highlights from Student Reviews**:
- The **tutor bio section** added credibility and improved user trust  
- **Notifications** helped reduce uncertainty around booking status  
- Having a **calendar and session logs** gave students better time control  
- The MVP is now seen as more “complete” and “ready for use”

> *“You listened. I remember last week ni-comment ko sa notifications, then karon naa na. Great job!”* — 4th Year BSTCM  
> *“I think maka-tabang jud ni especially sa mga subjects nga lisod like Data Structures.”* — 1st Year BSCS  

## Suggestions for Final Touches
Though most feedback was positive, students still offered helpful fine-tuning advice:

> *“Pwede unta ma-rate ang tutor after session para kabalo pud ang uban kung effective ba siya.”* — 3rd Year BSDS  
> *“I hope naa puy time availability sa profile mismo. Para di nako mag-click unya occupied diay siya.”* — 2nd Year BSIT  

Additional Suggestions:
- Add a **rating & feedback system** for tutor performance  
- Show **available time slots** directly on tutor cards  
- Include **subject-specific tags** for easier filtering  
- Add a **light/dark mode switch** for user comfort  

## What This Week Tells Us
The upgrades made a clear difference — and students **noticed**. There’s a growing sense of **trust** in the app’s usefulness, and a strong desire to see it launched campus-wide.

> *“This could really change how we study. It’s not just an app — murag learning companion jud siya.”* — 2nd Year BSCS

Week 11 proved the power of listening to users and applying feedback rapidly. Our next steps will involve finalizing these last few adjustments and preparing Buddle for broader testing. As we edge closer to launch, student voices continue to shape what Buddle will become.
