In **Week 9**, I facilitated an interview session during our regular **SCITC Student Council meeting** via **Google Meet**. A total of **32 council members** from various departments filled out the survey form and shared their feedback live. This group offered a **unique perspective**, blending student concerns with leadership insights on the academic experience across CITC.

## **Academic Challenges From Student Leaders**
**Cognitive Load & Time Pressure** – As student leaders, many respondents admitted they struggle with the **dual load of leadership responsibilities and academic tasks**.

> *“Naay times na mag focus ko sa council work, pero maka backlog na nuon ko sa schoolwork.”* — 3rd Year BSIT Student Leader

**Lack of Early Academic Interventions** – Several leaders raised the need for **preventive support**, especially for freshmen who feel lost early on.

> *“Mga bag-o pa lang gani, murag wala na kabalo unsaon pag start. Wala silay klarong gi-agi nga guidance.”* — 2nd Year BSCS Representative

**Unclear Tutor Communication** – Others expressed that even if tutoring is available, it’s hard to reach the right person or know whom to contact.

> *“Okay unta ang tutoring, pero walay klaro nga communication kung asa or kanus-a mi maka-access.”* — 4th Year BSTCM Officer

**Varying Teaching Styles** – A recurring observation was the inconsistency in how subjects are taught, especially in technical or programming-based subjects.

> *“Lahi-lahi ang teaching style, uban ra mag lecture ra gyud. Kung wala kay background, lisod kaayo makasabot.”* — 3rd Year BSDS Core Member

## **Preferred Tutoring Systems and Suggestions**
The student leaders provided well-structured suggestions based on their experience facilitating activities and hearing concerns from their respective programs:

**Scheduled Study Clusters** – Department-based weekly study groups with peer facilitators  
**Skill-Based Tutoring** – Matching tutors based on specific topics (e.g., JavaScript, SQL, or UML diagrams)  
**Bridge Programs for First Years** – A Buddle initiative that focuses on easing students into college-level thinking  
**Tutor Profiles with Ratings** – So students know which tutors are effective and trusted  
**Drop-in Tutoring Booths During Midterms/Finals** – Easy access stations during peak weeks  

## **Summarized Needs**
- More accessible, organized, and transparent tutor coordination  
- Mentorship models for freshmen or struggling students  
- Better balance between academics and leadership responsibilities  
- A feedback loop that continuously refines academic support systems  

## **Conclusion**
Week 9 gave us insight into how **student leaders balance responsibilities** while still facing the same academic burdens as their peers. Their strategic suggestions emphasize not just fixing academic issues—but **designing systems that prevent them**. Buddle’s next step? Building frameworks that not only support learners—but empower student leaders to be a part of the solution.
