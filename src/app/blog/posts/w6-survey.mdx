In **Week 6** of our research for **Project Buddle**, Mr. Ruperto Japay led interviews with **seven students**, centering on **how students access learning resources and whether current materials provide enough support**. The findings reveal a **growing reliance on external study aids**, highlighting the need for a more **structured and accessible academic support system**.

## **Challenges in Accessing Learning Materials**  
Students expressed concerns about the **inconsistency** in how course materials are provided. Some instructors offer **detailed lecture slides, recorded discussions, and supplementary notes**, while others rely mostly on **classroom lectures with limited additional resources**. This inconsistency creates **learning gaps**, forcing students to look elsewhere for materials, such as:  
- **YouTube tutorials** â€“ Video explanations help simplify complex topics.  
- **Online learning platforms** â€“ Interactive courses provide structured guidance.  
- **Coding exercises and external references** â€“ Practical applications enhance understanding.  

Students emphasized the need for a **centralized academic resource hub** where lecture notes, recorded lectures, and additional references can be **easily accessed in one place**.

## **The Shift Towards More Engaging Study Resources**  
Many students find **traditional textbooks and static lecture notes less effective** for their learning styles. Instead, they prefer:  
- **Multimedia content** â€“ Instructional videos and interactive tutorials make learning more engaging.  
- **Hands-on activities** â€“ Real-world applications enhance subject relevance.  
- **Step-by-step coding exercises** â€“ Practical examples improve problem-solving skills.  

By **modernizing study materials**, students believe that lessons could become **more engaging and accessible**.

## **The Need for a More Organized Academic Support System**  
Another significant concern is the **lack of a structured academic support system**. While tutoring and faculty consultations exist, students often struggle to access them due to **unclear schedules and lack of awareness**. To address this, respondents suggested:  
- **An academic support platform** â€“ A system that centralizes study materials and tutoring services.  
- **Peer mentorship programs** â€“ Connecting students with experienced peers for guidance.  
- **Scheduled study sessions** â€“ Organized group reviews to reinforce learning.  

A more **structured support system** would ensure that **students always have access to the help they need**.

## **Conclusion and Next Steps**  
The feedback from **Week 6** highlights the importance of **standardized learning materials, interactive study resources, and better academic support**. Moving forward, **Project Buddle** will explore ways to **implement these solutions** to improve the **academic experience at CITC**.  

By providing **better access to materials, integrating engaging study tools, and strengthening academic support**, we can create a **more efficient and student-friendly learning environment**. ðŸš€
