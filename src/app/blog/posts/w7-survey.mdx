In **Week 7** of **Project Buddle**, I conducted **face-to-face interviews with ten students**, continuing our efforts to understand the academic struggles faced by learners within CITC. While the questions remained consistent, the answers provided **fresh insights and new angles**, further enriching our data for future improvements.

## **Common Academic Struggles**  
From this week's responses, several **recurring academic barriers** stood out:  
**Subject Overload** â€“ Students shared that some subjects cover **too many complex topics in a short time**, leaving little room for full comprehension.  
**Instructor Communication Gaps** â€“ A few respondents noted **instructors sometimes assume prior knowledge**, which can be discouraging for students needing foundational support.  
**Group Work Difficulties** â€“ Some learners experience challenges with **group dynamics**, such as unequal participation or miscommunication.  
**Resource Scarcity** â€“ Despite efforts, certain materials (like recorded lectures or topic summaries) are **still not easily accessible**.

## **Accessibility of Tutoring Support**  
When asked to rate tutoring availability, responses varied. Some praised peer support, while others still found it **difficult to locate reliable tutoring**â€”especially during exam seasons. Key concerns included:  
**Unclear tutor schedules**  
**Mismatch between tutor expertise and student needs**  
**Lack of subject-specific support in certain areas**

## **Preferred Forms of Academic Assistance**  
Students this week expressed preferences for the following formats:  
**Scheduled One-on-One Tutoring** â€“ Personalized and paced to individual needs.  
**Peer-led Study Circles** â€“ Informal group discussions where students help each other.  
**Recorded Micro-lectures** â€“ Short videos focused on high-difficulty topics.  
**Interactive Tutorials** â€“ Guided exercises for hands-on practice.

## **Recommendations for Improvement**  
To improve the learning experience, respondents proposed several ideas:  
**Study Companion Guides** â€“ Condensed handouts summarizing key lessons.  
**Regular Feedback Channels** â€“ Monthly forms or check-ins to voice academic concerns.  
**Instructor Office Hours** â€“ Scheduled times for easier access to mentors.  
**Buddle Integration** â€“ Incorporate these support formats into **Project Buddleâ€™s upcoming platform**, making them widely available to students.

## **Conclusion**  
The insights from **Week 7** reaffirm the importance of **listening to diverse student experiences**. By addressing communication gaps, enhancing access to tailored support, and promoting structured yet flexible tutoring formats, we can take stronger steps toward an improved academic environment.

With these insights, **Project Buddle** remains committed to designing solutions that truly reflect student needs. ðŸŒ±
