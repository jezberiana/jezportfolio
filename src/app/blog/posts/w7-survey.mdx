In **Week 7** of **Project Buddle**, I personally conducted **face-to-face interviews with 10 students** from various programs and year levels within CITC. While the questions remained consistent with previous weeks, the responses shed light on **core academic pain points**: lack of accessible tutoring, inconsistent teaching styles, and difficulty in grasping course materials without applied examples.

## **Student-Identified Challenges**
**Limited Concept Retention** – Many students expressed they quickly forget lessons because topics are rushed without follow-up activities.

> *"Pagkahuman sa lecture, wala na. Wala man gud application, so lisod madumduman."* — 2nd Year BSIT Student  

**Lecture-Heavy, Practice-Light Setup** – Students feel most classes are theory-focused without enough practical or hands-on work to reinforce understanding.

> *"Grabe ka bug-at ang theory, pero gamay ra kaayo mi ma-practice sa actual coding."* — 3rd Year BSCS Student  

**Minimal Instructor Engagement** – Some respondents noted that instructors don’t always entertain clarifications due to time limits or personal unavailability.

> *"Usahay makulbaan nami mangutana, kay murag busy si sir o si ma’am."* — 1st Year BSTCM Student  

**Underutilized Tutoring Services** – Several students were unaware that peer or organized tutoring options existed at all.

> *"Wala mi kahibalo naay ing-ana diay. Abi namo kami ra mag self-study."* — 2nd Year BSDS Student  

## **Tutoring Preferences and Suggestions**
Students voiced the need for more **student-centric support systems**:

**Peer Tutoring Channels** – Small study groups or Buddle-led tutoring hubs they can join easily  
**Tutorial Videos and Recorded Sessions** – Especially for programming and technical subjects  
**Tutor Request Portal** – A page where they can ask for help based on subjects or availability  
**Real-Life Applications** – Case-based learning, exercises tied to actual industry problems  

## **Summarized Needs**
- Clearer explanations and follow-through on difficult topics  
- Immediate feedback mechanisms from tutors or peers  
- More active learning strategies integrated into lectures  
- Awareness campaigns on tutoring availability and how to access help  

## **Conclusion**
The Week 7 responses reflect a growing need for **reinforced instructional support, better accessibility to tutors**, and **learning through practical application**. While students remain eager to learn, they are calling for a system that supports them more effectively—especially when lectures alone aren’t enough.

Through Buddle, we continue working toward a more **supportive and structured academic experience** for all CITC students.
