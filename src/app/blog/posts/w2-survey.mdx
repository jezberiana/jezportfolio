For the second week of our **Project Buddle** research, we held an **online interview via Google Meet**, where I presided over a discussion with the **Department of Academic Affairs and the Buddle Core Team**. This session helped us validate the academic challenges we identified last week and gather new insights from a different perspective.

## **Key Insights from the Interview**
With **seven respondents**, we discussed the primary concerns affecting studentsâ€™ academic performance. Their responses aligned with our previous findings but also provided additional depth:

### **1. Time Management Remains a Key Concern**  
Our respondents reinforced that students **struggle to balance** coursework, extracurricular activities, and personal life. They emphasized that **lack of structured tutoring schedules** makes it even harder to fit learning support into their routines.

### **2. The Need for a More Structured Tutoring System**  
Unlike last weekâ€™s general student responses, this group focused on the need for **formalized tutoring programs** within CITC. They suggested that Buddle should provide:  
- **Fixed schedules** for tutoring sessions.  
- **Pre-screened tutors** to ensure quality assistance.  
- **A tracking system** to monitor student progress over time.  

### **3. Limited Peer-to-Peer Academic Support**  
While students do help each other, there is **no structured peer tutoring program** within CITC. Many respondents agreed that an **officially recognized system** could bridge the gap and encourage more knowledge-sharing.

## **Challenges Experienced & How I Handled Them**
Since this was an **online interview**, some challenges included:  
- **Connection issues** affecting a few respondents.  
- **Difficulty in engagement**, as some participants were hesitant to share detailed opinions.  

To address these, I:  
- **Encouraged open discussion** by asking follow-up questions and creating a welcoming environment.  
- **Used structured prompts** to guide the conversation and keep it on track.  

## **Connecting These Findings to Project Buddle**
This interview solidified our understanding that **Buddle needs to be more than just a casual tutoring service**â€”it should provide:  
- **Structured schedules** for tutoring sessions.  
- **Verified tutors** who can ensure quality academic assistance.  
- **A monitoring system** to track student progress.  

These insights will be crucial as we refine our **problem statement** and begin shaping Buddleâ€™s core features.

## **Looking Ahead**
With **two weeks of research completed**, we now have a clearer picture of the **academic challenges faced by CITC students**. Our next step is to refine our **proposed solutions** and prepare for the next phase of development.  

Excited to bring Buddle closer to reality! ðŸš€
