In **Week 10**, we reached a major milestone — the **Buddle MVP (Minimum Viable Product)** was officially showcased to selected students for the very first time. Assigned for this round of face-to-face interviews was **Emmanuel Sonquipal**, who gathered feedback from **15 student respondents**. These participants were given hands-on access to the app, followed by a guided walkthrough of its current features. The goal: understand how real users perceive the app’s usability, functionality, and potential impact.

## What Students Liked
Students gave strong initial reactions to Buddle’s interface and overall direction:

> *“Straightforward siya. I like nga naay list sa available tutors og ang filters kay useful.”* — 2nd Year BSIT Student  
> *“The minimalist design helps. I don’t feel overwhelmed bisan daghan og info.”* — 3rd Year BSCS Student  

**Highlights from the MVP Walkthrough**:
- The **Tutor List** and **Search Filter** received praise for ease of use  
- Students appreciated the **Booking System** for its clarity and flow  
- The clean, responsive **UI design** was widely seen as student-friendly  
- The **focus on academic-level filters (subject, topic)** was seen as practical  

## Suggestions for Improvement
Alongside the praise, students also shared thoughtful ideas for improvements:

> *“Maayo unta kung naay short preview sa tutor’s expertise or subjects covered.”* — 1st Year BSDS Student  
> *“Wala pa kaayo notification features. Di ko sure kung makita nako dayon if mo-reply ang tutor.”* — 4th Year BSTCM Student  

Common Suggestions:
- Add **tutor profiles with mini bios**, ratings, and subject strengths

- Include a **history tab** for previous tutoring sessions  
- Add a **calendar view** to help students manage multiple bookings  
- Option to **chat or ask pre-questions** before officially booking a tutor  

## Students See the Vision
More importantly, many students saw **Buddle not just as an app—but a solution**:

> *“This feels like something we actually need. Not all instructors are reachable, so having a peer tutoring app is smart.”* — 2nd Year BSIT  
> *“Mura siyag academic Grab. Easy access to help. I'm excited once full features roll out.”* — 3rd Year BSCS
